### Technical Roadmap 


The final goal of Second is to be a personalized, not awkward to use, AI for you or your business, acting as a middleman/negotiator/guardian whenever you want to view or exchange data. For example, if Sally wants to see messages sent from Bob, her Second would handle requesting messages from Bob's Second and displaying them in the list-like UI that Sally prefers. 

In order to provide a non-awkward experience, the AI needs to know everything about you, and with that level of trust, you should be in complete control of the AI. This is the roadmap to building that AI. 

1. __Simple building blocks__  
Foundation for a "communication OS" that is infinitely upgradeable and can handle any data  
1. __Collaboration and communication__  
Tooling for sharing apps and data and collaborative improvement of underlying infrastructure  
1. __Personalization__  
Consumerization of apps and sharing   
1. __Bigger and Better Datasets__  
Public and private datastores grow with more precise and varied data   
1. __Better AI__  
Improved ML algorithms working on better data, user-owned and controlled  


#### Stage 1 (Foundation) 

~~New filesystem (node = file+directory+validation)~~  
~~New routing layer~~  
~~Multi-platform support (cloud, browser, iOS/Android, RPi3)~~  


#### Stage 2 (App Platform) 

~~Cloud Default App~~  
~~Browser app: app store and editor~~  
Browser/Mobile apps: social sharing (private, customizable twitter/fb)  
Browser/Mobile/IoT apps: automation  
Mobile/Iot development guides  


#### Stage 3 (Scalability and Adoption) 

Platform change support (platform-as-upgradeable)  
Security reviews  





### Team 

We're a small team with great advisors, based in San Francisco. 


### History 

We began working on the idea for Second in 2013. In early 2018 alpha software was released with the core concepts and fundamentals (identity, language, hosting).
